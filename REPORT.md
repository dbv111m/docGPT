# RAG System Technical Report

## Approach

The RAG system is built using Langchain, Langchain Community, FAISS document store, and LLAMA3 model from Ollama. It follows a retrieval-augmented generation approach, where relevant documents are retrieved based on the user's question, and then the LLAMA3 model is used to generate an answer based on the retrieved context.

The system exposes a REST API using FastAPI for interacting with the RAG functionality. It also includes a simple frontend interface built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

## Challenges Faced

1. Integrating different libraries and components: Integrating Langchain, Langchain Community, FAISS, and LLAMA3 model required careful configuration and understanding of their interfaces.

2. Handling large document sets: Processing and storing large numbers of documents efficiently was a challenge. This was addressed by using FAISS for efficient document retrieval and implementing background tasks for document processing.

3. Ensuring answer relevance: Generating relevant answers based on the retrieved context was crucial. This was tackled by fine-tuning the QA prompt template and implementing a relevance check using cosine similarity.

## Solutions Implemented

1. Asynchronous processing: Asynchronous programming with async/await was used to handle time-consuming tasks like document processing and question answering without blocking the main event loop.

2. Background tasks: Document processing tasks were offloaded to background tasks using Python's asyncio library, allowing the API to remain responsive while processing large document sets.

3. Containerization: The application was containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, ensuring easy deployment and reproducibility across different environments.

4. Frontend interface: A simple frontend interface was built using Streamlit to provide a user-friendly way to interact with the RAG system, allowing users to upload documents and ask questions.

5. Error handling and logging: Proper error handling and logging mechanisms were implemented to capture and handle exceptions gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to the users and facilitating debugging.

## Future Improvements

1. Fine-tuning the LLAMA3 model: Fine-tuning the LLAMA3 model on domain-specific data could improve the quality and relevance of the generated answers.

2. Implementing user authentication and authorization: Adding user authentication and authorization mechanisms would ensure secure access to the RAG system and protect sensitive documents.

3. Enhancing the frontend interface: The frontend interface could be further enhanced with additional features like document management, search functionality, and user-friendly error handling.

4. Scaling the system: Investigating ways to scale the RAG system horizontally, such as distributing the document store across multiple nodes, could improve performance and handle larger document sets.

5. Continuous improvement based on user feedback: Collecting user feedback and iteratively improving the system based on their needs and experiences would ensure a more user-centric solution.
